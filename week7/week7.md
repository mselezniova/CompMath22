# Week 7: Symbolic computation with SymPy

In this class, we start working with [SymPy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) library for symbolic computation. Except for the lecture notes, you can check out the [SymPy tutorial](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/index.html#intro-tutorial) to prepare for this class.
