    "# Exercise 8.1: SIS model\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to the SIR model, which we studied in one of the previous classes, is the [SIS model](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIS-Modell). In this model an individual does not become immune after recovering from an infection but becomes susceptible again. Thus, there are only two states: $S$ (susceptible) and $I$ (infectious). As before, there are also two hyperparameters: infection rate $\\beta$ and recovery/death rate $\\gamma$. Then the differential equations system describing the model are given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta IS + \\gamma I, \\quad \\dfrac{dI}{dt} = \\beta IS - \\gamma I$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We further assume that $I+S = 1$ and denote $\\delta = \\beta-\\gamma$. Then the above system simplifies to the following single ODE:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{dI}{dt} = (\\delta - \\beta I) I$$\n",

    "# Exercise 8.2: Python scripts and modules\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been using Jupyter notebook to run Python code. This option is great to examine and present your code interactively and to combine the code with plots, text, equations, etc. However, there are multiple situations (e.g. running code remotely or the exam ðŸ˜‰) where you need to use a more conventional way to write and run Python code, namely **Python scripts**. In this task, we learn how to use Python scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What are Python scripts?** Python scripts are simply `*.py` files, which contain a set of Python commands .\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to write/edit such files?** You can use a text editor (any standard editor on your computer would work but there are also editors made specifically for code, such as [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com)) or a Python IDE (e.g. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org)). \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to run a script?** To run a Python script, you can simply type `python script_name.py` in a terminal window. If you are using an IDE, there is typically also a \"Run\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are scripts executed?** Python scripts are executed *linearly*, i.e. all the code simpy runs in the order in which the script contains it. This is in contrast with Jupyter notebooks, where you can have multiple code cells and run them in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Create a script `primes.py`, which contains two functions from Exercise 3.1: the function that checks whether a number is a prime and the factorization function. Within your script, check whether numbers 17, 28, 131, 1573 are primes and factorize numbers 15793 and 15797. Print all the answers in a readable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** As you know from the first exercise class, Python modules (libraries) are also simpy `*.py` files. Thus, you can turn your script into a library! Leave only the definitions of the two functions in your script. Then import your script as a module in this Jupyter notebook (`import primes`). Note that the script has to be in the same directory as the notebook for this to work. Try using the functions from your library inside the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** There is a well-known Python idiom `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`, which *allows you to execute code when the file runs as a script, but not when itâ€™s imported as a module*. You can read, for example, this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/if-name-main-python/) to understand this idiom better. Modify your `primes.py` script so that it simply contains the two functions from Exercise 3.1 when it is imported as a module but prints all the results required in part **a)** of this exercise when it is executed as a script.
