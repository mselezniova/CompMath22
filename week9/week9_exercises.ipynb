    "**c)** To check whether the point(s) with $G=0$ are minima/maxima, we need to check if the hessian is positive/negative definite. Try checking positive definiteness of $H$ using sympy. You will see that sympy methods cannot directly determine whether $H$ is positive definite in our case. Thus, calculate the determinant of $H$ and observe that it is positive by [Cauchy-Schwarz inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchyâ€“Schwarz_inequality). As the first leading principal minor of $H$ is also positive, we have positive-definiteness by [Sylvester's criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester%27s_criterion)."
