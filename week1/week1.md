# Week 1: Installing Python, intro to Python

We installed Miniconda, which includes a Python distribution and a package installer called [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), in the first exercise class. We then used pip to install [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install). We also covered a part of introduction to Python, namely importing modules, namespaces and help pages. 

**Resources:**

*  Instructions to install Miniconda: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html
* Bash tutorial for beginners: https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners
*  A comprehensive Python tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ 



For now, you can read only the following parts of the Python tutorial, which cover the topics that we considered in the class so far in more depth:

*  [An informal introduction to Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html)
*  [Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
*  [Namespaces and Scopes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-word-about-names-and-objects) (only sections 9.1 and 9.2)
