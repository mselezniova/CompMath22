    "# Exercise 6.1: SIR model\n",
    "\n",
    "[The SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) is a simple mathematical model to simulate epidemics. The population is divided into three groups: **S**usceptible, **I**nfectious and **R**emoved (recovered or dead). The size of the respective groups is given as functions of time $S(t)$, $I(t)$ and $R(t)$. It is also assumed that there is an infection rate $\\beta$ and a recovery/death rate $\\gamma$. Then the model is defined by the following differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta I S, \\quad \\dfrac{dI}{dt} = \\beta I S - \\gamma I, \\quad \\dfrac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Plot $S, I$ an $R$ for $\\beta=0.4$ and $\\gamma=0.04$ for $t\\in[0,100]$ and initial conditions $S(0)=0.997$, $I(0)=0.03$ and $R(0)=0$ (you can use `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function). Add all the necessary captions to the plot."
