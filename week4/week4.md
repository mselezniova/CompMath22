In this class, we start the introduction to the [NumPy](https://numpy.org) library for linear algebra and scientific computing, which we will also use extensively in all the future classes.  

For now, you can have a look at [NumPy: the absolute basics for beginners](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) guide to get familiar with the basic concepts and prepare for this class.
